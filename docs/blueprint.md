# **App Name**: Invoice Insights

## Core Features:

- Invoice Upload: Enables users to upload Cargomen invoices (PDF format).
- Intelligent Data Extraction: Uses AI to extract key fields (Invoice Date, Invoice No, HAWB No, Terms of Invoice, Job Number) and classify ambiguous charges as either 'Cargomen Own Charges' or 'Reimbursement Charges'. The AI model acts as a tool to recognize context and keywords to perform the classification and can correct OCR noise.
- Excel Output: Generates an Excel (.xlsx) file with data extracted from the invoices. The Excel file includes columns for Invoice Date, Invoice No, HAWB No, Terms of Invoice, Job Number, Cargomen Own Charges, and Reimbursement Charges.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral white or light gray for the background.
- Secondary color: Dark gray or black for text to ensure readability.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights, providing a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Clean and structured layout with clear sections for invoice uploading, data display, and Excel output options.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for actions like 'Upload', 'Download', and 'Analyze'.
- Subtle loading animations during invoice processing and data extraction.
